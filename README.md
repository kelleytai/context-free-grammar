# context-free-grammar

I develooped two context-free grammars for the chart parser in NLTK, each covering
an interesting and not-entirely-trivial subset of English, along with a lexicon and a set
of test sentences. This grammar contains verbs agreement and subcategorization. Subcategorizaiton refers to the specification that a particular word places on the possible complements (objects)
that it can occur with. 

My report contains what my grammar can and canâ€™t do. It also includes how I tested my grammar and the limitations my grammar is bounded by.
