# context-free-grammar

I developed a context-free grammar for the chart parser in NLTK, each covering
an interesting and not-entirely-trivial subset of English, along with a lexicon and a set
of test sentences. My grammar encompasses verb agreement and subcategorization. Subcategorizaiton refers to the specification that a particular word places on the possible complements (objects) that it can occur with. 

My report contains what my grammar can and canâ€™t do. It also includes how I tested my grammar and the limitations my grammar is bounded by. 

This grammar was created for the purposes of University of Toronto's CSC485 - Computational Linguistics and redefined by me after the course was over.
